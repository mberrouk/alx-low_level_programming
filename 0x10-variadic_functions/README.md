# 0x10. C - Variadic Functions

This project is about learning and understanding the usage of variadic functions in C programming.

## Description

In this project, we will explore the concept of variadic functions in C. Variadic functions are functions which take a variable number of arguments.
We will be implementing various functions to understand this concept better.

## Files

* `variadic_functions.h`: Header file containing the prototypes of the functions.
* `0-sum_them_all.c`: A function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
* `1-print_numbers.c`: A function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
* `2-print_strings.c`: A function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
* `3-print_all.c`: A function that prints anything.

## Usage

Each file is a separate program:

* Compile the C files with `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c`
* Run the executable: `./a.out`
