# 0x08-recursion

This project is part of ALX School's low-level programming and focuses on recursion in the C programming language. The project includes several tasks that challenge students to develop a deep understanding of recursion and apply it to real-world programming problems.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a working knowledge of C programming and a development environment set up on your computer, including a C compiler and any necessary libraries.

## Project Tasks

The project includes several tasks, each of which is designed to challenge students and help them develop their skills in recursion. The tasks include:

- **0-puts_recursion.c**: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.
- **1-print_rev_recursion.c**: A function that prints a string in reverse, using recursion.
- **2-strlen_recursion.c**: A function that returns the length of a string, using recursion.
- **3-factorial.c**: A function that returns the factorial of a given number, using recursion.
- **4-pow_recursion.c**: A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y, using recursion.
- **5-sqrt_recursion.c**: A function that returns the natural square root of a number, using recursion.
- **6-is_prime_number.c**: A function that checks if a number is a prime number, using recursion.
- **7-is_palindrome.c**: A function that checks if a string is a palindrome, using recursion.
