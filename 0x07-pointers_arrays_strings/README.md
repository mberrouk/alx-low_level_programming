# 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

This project is part of alx School's low-level programming curriculum and focuses on pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. The project includes several tasks that challenge students to develop a deep understanding of these concepts and apply them to real-world programming problems.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a working knowledge of C programming and a development environment set up on your computer, including a C compiler and any necessary libraries.

## Project Tasks

The project includes several tasks, each of which is designed to challenge students and help them develop their skills in pointers, arrays, and strings. The tasks include:

- **0-memset.c**: A function that fills memory with a constant byte.
- **1-memcpy.c**: A function that copies memory area.
- **2-strchr.c**: A function that locates a character in a string.
- **3-strspn.c**: A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
- **4-strpbrk.c**: A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
- **5-strstr.c**: A function that locates a substring.
- **7-print_chessboard.c**: A function that prints the chessboard.
- **8-print_diagsums.c**: A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
- **9-set_string.c**: A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
