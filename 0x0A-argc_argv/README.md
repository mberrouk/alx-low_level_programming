# 0x0A-argc_argv

This project is part of the ALX School curriculum and is designed to teach students how to work with command line arguments in C. By completing this project, students will gain a deeper understanding of how to write C programs that can accept input from the command line.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to use command line arguments in C
- Learn how to parse command line arguments
- Understand how to handle errors when working with command line arguments
- Learn how to write programs that can accept input from the command line

## Requirements

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Code must follow the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) style guide
- No global variables are allowed
- Function prototypes should be included in a header file called `main.h`

## Project Tasks

The project is broken down into several tasks, each of which builds on the previous one:

### 0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to

Write a program that prints its name, followed by a newline.

### 1. Silence is argument carried out by other means

Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it, followed by a newline.

### 2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter

Write a program that prints all arguments it receives, one argument per line, followed by a newline.

### 3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument

Write a program that multiplies two numbers passed as arguments, followed by a newline.

### 4. To infinity and beyond

Write a program that adds positive numbers passed as arguments, followed by a newline. If no numbers are passed, the program should print `0`.

## How to Use

To use this project, simply clone the repository and compile the files using `gcc`. Each task is contained in a separate C file, and the expected output is provided in a separate text file. To test your code, run the compiled executable and compare the output to the expected output.

## Conclusion

The 0x0A-argc_argv project is an essential tool for any C programmer who wants to develop a deeper understanding of command line arguments. By completing this project, students will gain valuable experience and skills that will help them succeed in their programming careers.
